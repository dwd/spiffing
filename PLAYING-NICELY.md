Playing Nicely
==============

This software is licensed under extremely liberal terms, with the hope that
this reduces any barriers to use to the absolute minimum.

However, the intent of the author is to actively maintain a useful library, and
therefore licensors are requested -- though not mandated -- to pass back any
changes and improvements for inclusion in the upstream copy.
