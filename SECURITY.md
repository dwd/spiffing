Security Considerations
=======================

This software is designed expressly for the purpose of security policy
enforcement, in this case enforcing an information handling model. Therefore
security issues in particular are treated with the upmost importance.

In the first instance, a security issue may be sent directly to the author,
Dave Cridland <dave.cridland@surevine.com>

If this does not generate a timely response, please contact Surevine Ltd via
any private method.

Suitability Statement
=====================

Note that at the current point in time, this software is not considered
production-ready, and is therefore unsuited to high-assurance systems. It may
be useful in support of experimental work.

In particular, no claim is made that the software has, or is suited for, any
accreditation.

If use in a production environment is desired, please contact Surevine Ltd.
